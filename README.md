# Email Archive Manager for Zen Cart
## DESCRIPTION

Zen Cart has a great email archiving feature.  When enabled, every email sent through your cart is stored in a database table. Unfortunately, the Zen Cart Admin does not offer the possibility to review the archived emails.

This plugin adds this functionality.

Tested with Zen Cart 1.5.x and php8.

I hope you find it useful, enjoy!

## INSTALLATION

Always test ANY plugin on a development copy of your shop FIRST: NEVER trust any third-party to be 100% compatible "out of the box" with YOUR shop.

Always backup your shop and database before making changes.

1. Download the package and unzip to a temp directory.
2. Copy the contents of entire "ADMIN_FOLDER" directory to your (renamed) admin folder.
The files are already arranged in the appropriate structure, and there are *no* overwrites of core files!
3. You'll find "Email Archive Manager" under "Tools" in the Admin. You may need to assign it to admin user profiles, if you use them.
4. By default, email archiving is turned off; to start archiving emails, you must turn it on under
   admin->configuration->email options->Email Archiving Active?

For display purposes, two constants are available to modify:
define('SUBJECT_SIZE_LIMIT', 0); // restrict the subject line length. 0 means no restriction
define('MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT', 600); // length of the message excerpt shown in the infoBox

These are located in the main file:

ADMIN_FOLDER\email_archive_manager.php
